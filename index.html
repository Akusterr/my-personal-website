    <p class="bio">
        Hello, my name is Alexa Kuster. <br/>
        I've spend half my life working in the restaurant industry.
        Through this time i've gained an extensive knowledge on how people work and how to best interpret their needs.
        This understanding paired with my curiosity for tech and desire to be challenged in life has lead me to seek out a new career.<br/>

        I have taken self-paced tutorials and workshops in hopes of learning more about the task I have undertaken.
        Once I was sure I wanted to persue a career as a Developer and recieved countless recommendations to apply to Flatiron School, 
        I knew it was time. 

        My goal now is to deepen my knowledge of development skills in order to achieve my goal 
        of landing a job as a developer. I believe Flatiron will help me achieve that goal and them some.
